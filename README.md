Our story: (possible visualizations)  Create visualizations depicting generation of renewable energy (%) to visualize US efforts.  We will report which states are generating the most renewable energy resources.  We hypothesize that the western US states are ‘greener’ than the eastern states because they have the highest renewable energy production.
•Renewable energy consumption by state
•Renewable energy generation by state
•Natural gas, nuclear, wind, solar, geo-thermal, hydro
•Weather data by state (wind, sun,)
•Nuclear energy by state (nuclear power stations imposed over states)
•US vs Global
